This project started out from a desire for an umbrella to hold all my other projects and code in a presentable manner for the web.  

This needed to be a project in itself, to utilize and showcase many front-end principles and practices i have learned.  

What you see here is the current product, a desin is never finshed and there are always tweaks and small improvements that can be made.  i consider this a version 1.0 product right now, and i hope to continually make improvements and add content as i learn and create.
